# Code_Refactor

short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

In this project, I have edited the HTML and CSS basecode to optimize it for search engines. Additionaly, I have edited the code so it is visually aesthetic and easy to read. 

I have done this by adding in semantic HTML elements to replace the unorganised div containers. I have organised the code in subsequential order to match the website layout, added image alt attributes and added a descriptive title for the page. I also corrected the navigation buttons so that they direct to the correct piece of information on the page. 

By doing these things, it is now more acessible for future developers that are to edit this code.
